# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles config

## Installation

Get the bootstrap script and pipe it into your shell (Don't pipe it if you want to see what it's doing):

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neonsamurai/dotfiles/master/script/bootstrap | sh
```


Get some coffee, this will take a while.

Enjoy your boot strapped MacBook!
